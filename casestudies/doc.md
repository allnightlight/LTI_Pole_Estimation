# 1. Introduction

Pole distribution is a feature to describe the linear time-invariant (LTI) system.
According to the pole distribution of the system,
the different dynamism is observed in trend.

Linearly recurrent network (LRN) system is a branch
of the sequential model in the machine learning.
Networks can be trained base on datasets 
by using machine learning algorithms.

We study empirically how trained LRN systems
estimate the pole distribution of targeted LTI systems
and how to improve the estimation by tuning training hyperparameters.
